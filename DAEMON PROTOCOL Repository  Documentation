DAEMON PROTOCOL: Silent Deployment Phase

PROJECT STATUS: BRAND VALIDATION (ZERO-COST MODEL)

This repository hosts the front-end code for DAEMON PROTOCOL, a conceptual apparel line engineered for the architecture of focus. This project is currently operating in the Silent Deployment Phase (V0.1), utilizing a zero-budget, lead-generation strategy to validate product demand.

The purpose of this repository is to serve the live, A.I. Protocol-themed website via GitHub Pages.

1. LIVE SITE ACCESS

The full, interactive A.I. Protocol interface is deployed from this repository.

Access Protocol:
[Insert your GitHub Pages URL here, e.g., https://yourusername.github.io/daemon-protocol-store/]

Primary Function: Lead Capture / Waitlist Generation. The "Add to Cart" function has been replaced with "REQUEST ACCESS (JOIN WAITLIST)" to segment high-intent customers.

2. CORE PHILOSOPHY

DAEMON PROTOCOL crafts premium, minimalist apparel engineered for the architecture of focus. We are the quiet protocol, the essential background process for your deepest work.

Our commitment is to premium fabrication ($\geq 350 \text{ GSM}$ structured cotton) and a "felt, not seen" minimalist aesthetic.

3. ARCHITECTURE

The entire application is contained within a single index.html file to maximize speed and minimize hosting costs.

Front-End: Pure HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), and Vanilla JavaScript.

Design Language: Dark, Monospaced (Fira Code), Neon Cyan Accents.

Authentication/E-commerce: Disabled (Zero-Budget Model). Replaced with a Waitlist Modal for lead acquisition.

Future Transition: Designed for seamless migration to a dedicated platform (e.g., Shopify) upon successful validation.

[DP]: Status: Operational. Maintain silent deployment.
